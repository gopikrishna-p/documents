### ✅ **If you want to delete the folder and everything inside it:**

```bash
rm -rf birthday_wishes
```

**Explanation:**

* `rm` → remove
* `-r` → recursive (delete folder contents too)
* `-f` → force (skip confirmation)

---

### ⚠️ **If you want a confirmation for each file before deletion:**

```bash
rm -r birthday_wishes
```

It will ask “remove regular file …?” for each item.

---

### 🧹 **If the directory is empty:**

```bash
rmdir birthday_wishes
```

But this works **only if it’s completely empty**.

---

After deleting, you can verify with:

```bash
ls
```

---

Would you like me to show how to delete it **safely (with a backup)** before removing it completely?
