You're using a **React + Node.js (full-stack)** project, and your `index.html` is inside:

```
resort-application/frontend/public/index.html
```

This structure won’t directly work with **GitHub Pages** because:

* GitHub Pages only serves **static files** (HTML/CSS/JS)
* It needs `index.html` at the **root level** (or `/docs` folder)
* React apps need to be **built** (`npm run build`) before deployment

---

### ✅ Here's how to **make this live on GitHub Pages**:

---

## 🔧 Option 1: Deploy React App Using GitHub Pages (Best for Frontend Only)

#### 🔁 Step-by-step (one-time setup):

1. Open terminal → navigate to `frontend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install GitHub Pages plugin:

   ```bash
   npm install gh-pages --save-dev
   ```

3. Open `package.json` and add the following lines:

   * Add **homepage** (replace your username and repo name):

     ```json
     "homepage": "https://gopikrishna-p.github.io/resort-application"
     ```

   * Add scripts:

     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "predeploy": "npm run build",
       "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
     }
     ```

4. Build and deploy:

   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

---

### ✅ After deployment:

Your frontend will be live at:
🔗 `https://gopikrishna-p.github.io/resort-application`

---

## 🛑 If using both frontend and backend:

GitHub Pages **won’t** support your backend (`server.py`, `.env`, etc.).

Instead, you can:

* Host frontend on GitHub Pages or **Vercel**
* Host backend on **Render** or **Railway**

---

### ⏭️ Want me to help deploy your backend to Render or frontend to Vercel?

Just say:

* `Deploy frontend to Vercel`
* `Deploy backend to Render`
* or both!

I'll give you exact steps with screenshots and code.
